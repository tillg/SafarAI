# Visualize Browser Events

In the SafarAI I want to see what happens in the browser:
- What events happen? I.e. 
  - Switch Tab
  - Open another page
  - close a page/tab
  - Click on a link
- The user should be able to choose where those events are listed: At the bottom, the top or right of the chat history.
- The user can click-open or unfold an event to see details, i.e.
  - User opens page
    - --> Page content
  - User switches tab
    - --> New list of open tabs
