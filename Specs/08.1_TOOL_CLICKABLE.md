# Tools clickable

As a user I also want to see the available tools, and potentially execute them.

- On the top right part of the chat column we want a button "Tools". When clicked we get
  - A popup window
  - Listing all tools, the tool names are buttons
  - Next to the toolname-button we see the expolanation of what the tool does.
  - When clicking a toolname-button it executes the tool. And it is listed in the Event history.
